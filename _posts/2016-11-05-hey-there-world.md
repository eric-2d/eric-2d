clearpixel has existed for a long time in the minds of it's creators. But today marks it's first appearance on the world wide web.
This gives it a very 'real' aspect both frightening and exciting.

At the moment various projects are in the pipe. They are being prioritized and the first selected one will undergo construction soon.

Let's make some cofee, get to work and see how far we can go!
